I suggest changing Naga's name to Naggah, to differential it from the mythical serpent creature
I like Jamal's name, because it can be an Arabic name as well as the Arabic name for camel. Can we make him black?

In the morning

N: <fresh> Good mornin' Jamal! Did you sleep well honey?
J: <sleepy, grumpy> Morning dear (or should i say camel lmao).. How am I supposed to sleep when you keep slapping me with your hump in your sleep? -_-
N: <surprised> Oh I'm sorry, but I did tell you that we need a bigger bed. Would you like a cup of tea to wake you up? I'll make it the way you like it. Black tea with my own milk! I've also got some cactus fruit for your breakfast in the fridge.
J: <Grateful> Thank you my love. I can start working on building a fence for our house after having your delicious tea to wake me up.
N: Good, we've been getting a lot of unwanted visitors recently. I'll get started on your tea. 
*opens fridge*
N: <confused> Jamal, did you drink the milk I had stored in the fridge? You know you're not supposed to do that without telling me.
J: <defensive> I didn't touch your milk woman. Are you sure it isn't there?
N: <frustrated> Of course I am. I had 2 full bottles in there but there aren't there now!
J: Well can't you just make more?
N: <more frustrated> No Jamal, we live in the desert so hydration is hard to come by. Wait minute

*Naggah notices some things on the kitchen floor*

N: It's a small pellet, a fancy piece of paper, and a hair which doesn't look like it came from a camel. Where did these come from? 
J: I don't know. Someone must have come in here while we were sleeping. They probably stole your milk.
N: <shocked> Oh my Allah! 
J: <annoyed> It's fine honey, I just go to the store and buy some more milk.
N: No way! I know you only like my milk, and not some smelly cow's milk. <determined> you wait here my love. I will find whoever stole my milk and make them suffer >:(
J: <nonchalantly> Isn't that a little excessive?
N: Not at all. This deed shall not go unanswered. I will bring justice to the culprate of which he has never seen! (needs work)
J: <tired> I'm too sleepy for this. I'll have a nap until you come back. Good luck your your justice baby.
N: <determination intensifies> You do that dear. THEY WILL RUE THE DAY THEY DECIDED TO STEAL FROM NAGGAH. RUE I SAY. 

*naggah rushes out of front door*

N: <thinking to herself> Wait.. How am I going to find the thief

*looks at clues from earlier*

N: <thinking to herself> The pellet must have come from the Jaber the Jerboa. I think it's time to give him a visit.

*runs across desert*
