[11:34] <Human14> Hello :)
[11:35] <Human14> I got a question regarding Kopala, warden of waves
[11:35] <Volo> Go for it
[11:36] <Human14> Does he increase the cost of triggered abilities? eg, if I summon a hostage taker and trigger her ability to exile kopala, will i have to pay an extra 2 mana?
[11:36] <Volo> Nope. Triggered abilities don't get taxed. Only spells and activated abilities.
[11:37] <Human14> Ok thanks :)
